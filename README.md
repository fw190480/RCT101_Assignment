## **How I managed the state and props** 
in this problem I decleare all the states in the ticTacToe components like players name , players score and one more state inside the game board for knowing who win the match and then with the help of events pass the winner to back to the ticTacToe component this process continue when a player win the match and now in the ticTacTow component I would change the states of player when player win the match and i pass this information with the help of props to the score board component and updated the score if player end the game in these case compare the score and which player win whose data i would pass to the finished components and then to the winner components.
